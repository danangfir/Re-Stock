<h1 style="text-align: center; font-size: 2em;">Re-Stock</h1>

This stock management program utilizes Python Flask, Bulma CSS, and a binary search tree (BST) algorithm for efficient data storage and retrieval. The user interface is designed to be intuitive and visually appealing, with clear labels and instructions for each action. The program allows users to add, update, and delete stock items, as well as view the current stock levels and search for specific items.

The BST algorithm is implemented in Python using a Node class that includes attributes for the item name, description, and current stock level, as well as a reference to the left and right child nodes. The program includes several routes for interacting with the BST and managing the stock data. The "add item" route allows users to insert a new node into the BST, the "view item" route allows users to search for a specific item and view its details, the "update item" route allows users to modify the attributes of an existing node, and the "delete item" route allows users to remove a node from the BST. Overall, this program is a powerful and flexible tool for anyone who needs to manage their inventory effectively.
